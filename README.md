# CS-4150-Concepts-of-Programming
The purpose of this course was to cover the fundamental concepts on which programming languages are based and the execution models supporting them. Topics included values, variables, bindings, type systems, control structures, exceptions, concurrency, and moularity. Languages representing different paradigms are introduced.

Within was our project where we had to develop an interpreter to read a set of grammar and pull tokens in the correct sequence with appropriate errors if applicable. We created this in 3 languages: Java, Python, and Ada
